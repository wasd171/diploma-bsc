Formulae are found which are valid at high frequencies, so long as the size of the particle is small compared with the wavelength and the packing is not too great. Special cases treated are iron-dust cores and expanded dielectrics in which the {\^{A}}particles{\^{A}} are air bubbles. For ferromagnetic materials, weak fields only are assumed, so that the results refer to initial permeability. On account of the heterogeneity of the mixture, the permeability may become {\^{A}}lossy{\^{A}} (i.e. {\^{A}} may be complex). Even when the substances are all non-ferromagnetic, the permeability of the mixture may depart from unity, or be complex.},

abstract = {Interference of optically induced electric and magnetic modes in high-index all-dielectric nanoparticles offers unique opportunities for tailoring directional scattering and engineering the flow of light. In this article we demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that the interference of electric and magnetic optically induced modes in individual subwavelength silicon nanodisks can lead to the suppression of resonant backscattering and to enhanced resonant forward scattering of light. To this end we spectrally tune the nanodisk's fundamental electric and magnetic resonances with respect to each other by a variation of the nanodisk aspect ratio. This ability to tune two modes of different character within the same nanoparticle provides direct control over their interference, and, in consequence, allows for engineering the particle's resonant and off-resonant scattering patterns. Most importantly, measured and numerically calculated transmittance spectra reveal that backward scattering can be suppressed and forward scattering can be enhanced at resonance for the particular case of overlapping electric and magnetic resonances. Our experimental results are in good agreement with calculations based on the discrete dipole approach as well as finite-integral frequency-domain simulations. Furthermore, we show useful applications of silicon nanodisks with tailored resonances as optical nanoantennas with strong unidirectional emission from a dipole source.},

While substrate leakage loss has warranted the necessity of substrate undercut structures in the past, we show here that the substrate has a very useful role to play for both passive chip-scale device integration as well as active electronic device integration. Two device architectures for the disk-on-substrate are studied in order to assess the possibility of such an integration of high Q resonators and active components. Using an optimized process for fabrication of such a resonator device, we experimentally demonstrate a Q approximately 3 x 10(6), corresponding to a propagation loss approximately 0.16 dB/cm. This, to our knowledge, is the maximum Q observed for silicon microdisk cavities of this size for disk-on-substrate structures. Critical coupling for a resonance mode with an unloaded Q approximately 0.7 x 10(6) is observed. We also report a detailed comparison of the obtained experimental resonance spectrum with the theoretical and simulation analysis. The issue of waveguide-cavity coupling is investigated in detail and the conditions necessary for the existence or lack of critical coupling is elaborated.},
