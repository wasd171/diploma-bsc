@article{Ginn2012,
abstract = {We demonstrate, for the first time, an all-dielectric metamaterial composite in the midinfrared based on micron-sized, high-index tellurium dielectric resonators. Dielectric resonators are desirable compared to conventional metallodielectric metamaterials at optical frequencies as they are largely angular invariant, free of Ohmic loss, and easily integrated into three-dimensional volumes. Measurements and simulation provide evidence of optical magnetism, which could be used for infrared magnetic mirrors, hard or soft surfaces, and subwavelength cavities.},

abstract = {A possibility to realize isotropic artificial backward-wave materials is theoretically analyzed. An improved mixing rule for the effective permittivity of a composite material consisting of two sets of resonant dielectric spheres in a homogeneous background is presented. The equations are validated using the Mie theory and numerical simulations. The effect of a statistical distribution of sphere sizes on the increasing of losses in the operating frequency band is discussed and some examples are shown.},

@article{Lewin1947,
abstract = {The paper investigates the values of permittivity and permeability of a mixture consisting of a homogeneous material in which particles are embedded. Formulae are found which are valid at high frequencies, so long as the size of the particle is small compared with the wavelength and the packing is not too great. Special cases treated are iron-dust cores and expanded dielectrics in which the {\^{A}}particles{\^{A}} are air bubbles. For ferromagnetic materials, weak fields only are assumed, so that the results refer to initial permeability. On account of the heterogeneity of the mixture, the permeability may become {\^{A}}lossy{\^{A}} (i.e. {\^{A}} may be complex). Even when the substances are all non-ferromagnetic, the permeability of the mixture may depart from unity, or be complex.},

abstract = {Increasing attention on metamaterials has been paid due to their exciting physical behaviors and potential applications. While most of such artificial material structures developed so far are based on metallic resonant structures, Mie resonances of dielectric particles open a simpler and more versatile route for construction of isotropic metamaterials with higher operating frequencies. Here, we review the recent progresses of Mie resonance-based metamaterials by providing a description of the underlying mechanisms to realize negative permeability, negative permittivity and double negative media. We address some potential novel applications. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
