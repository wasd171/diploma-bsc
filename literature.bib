For normal-incidence conditions, they exhibit a pronounced fundamental magnetic mode, arising from a coupling via the electric component of the incident light. For oblique incidence, a coupling via the magnetic component is demonstrated as well. Moreover, we identify a novel higher-order magnetic resonance at around 370 THz (800 nm wavelength) that evolves out of the Mie resonance for oblique incidence. Comparison with theory delivers good agreement and also shows that the structures allow for a negative magnetic permeability.},

In this paper we study optical resonances of Si nanocylinders located on a silica substrate. Multipole analysis of the experimental scattering spectra, based on the decomposed discrete dipole approximation, confirms resonant excitation of electric and magnetic dipole modes in the Si nanocylinders. Influences of light polarization and incident angle on the scattering properties of the nanocylinders are studied. It is shown that the dependence of resonant excitation of the electric and magnetic modes in the nanocylinders on incident angle and polarization of light allows controlling and manipulating the scattered light in this system. The demonstrated properties of Si nanocylinders can be used for the realization of dielectric metasurfaces with different functional optical properties.},

It is shown experimentally and numerically that when the magnetic resonance is excited by a pump beam, the angular dependence of the third harmonic signal has a local maximum at an incidence angle of $\theta$≃20∘<math><mrow><mi>&theta;<mo>&#8771;<msup><mn>20<mo>&#8728;. This maximum is shown to be a fingerprint of the antisymmetric distribution of currents in the gold layers. An analytical model based on the nonlinear dynamics of the electrons inside the gold shows excellent agreement with experimental and numerical results. This clearly indicates the difference in the third harmonic angular pattern at electric and magnetic resonances of the metamaterial.},

abstract = {We report the fabrication and experimental characterization of an ultra-high Q microdisk resonator in a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform. We examine the role of the substrate in the performance of such microdisk resonators. While substrate leakage loss has warranted the necessity of substrate undercut structures in the past, we show here that the substrate has a very useful role to play for both passive chip-scale device integration as well as active electronic device integration. Two device architectures for the disk-on-substrate are studied in order to assess the possibility of such an integration of high Q resonators and active components. Using an optimized process for fabrication of such a resonator device, we experimentally demonstrate a Q approximately 3 x 10(6), corresponding to a propagation loss approximately 0.16 dB/cm. This, to our knowledge, is the maximum Q observed for silicon microdisk cavities of this size for disk-on-substrate structures. Critical coupling for a resonance mode with an unloaded Q approximately 0.7 x 10(6) is observed. We also report a detailed comparison of the obtained experimental resonance spectrum with the theoretical and simulation analysis. The issue of waveguide-cavity coupling is investigated in detail and the conditions necessary for the existence or lack of critical coupling is elaborated.},

@article{Staude2013,
abstract = {Interference of optically induced electric and magnetic modes in high-index all-dielectric nanoparticles offers unique opportunities for tailoring directional scattering and engineering the flow of light. In this article we demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that the interference of electric and magnetic optically induced modes in individual subwavelength silicon nanodisks can lead to the suppression of resonant backscattering and to enhanced resonant forward scattering of light. To this end we spectrally tune the nanodisk's fundamental electric and magnetic resonances with respect to each other by a variation of the nanodisk aspect ratio. This ability to tune two modes of different character within the same nanoparticle provides direct control over their interference, and, in consequence, allows for engineering the particle's resonant and off-resonant scattering patterns. Most importantly, measured and numerically calculated transmittance spectra reveal that backward scattering can be suppressed and forward scattering can be enhanced at resonance for the particular case of overlapping electric and magnetic resonances. Our experimental results are in good agreement with calculations based on the discrete dipole approach as well as finite-integral frequency-domain simulations. Furthermore, we show useful applications of silicon nanodisks with tailored resonances as optical nanoantennas with strong unidirectional emission from a dipole source.},

@article{Xiao2010,
abstract = {The recently emerged fields of metamaterials and transformation optics promise a family of exciting applications such as invisibility, optical imaging with deeply subwavelength resolution and nanophotonics with the potential for much faster information processing. The possibility of creating optical negative-index metamaterials (NIMs) using nanostructured metal-dielectric composites has triggered intense basic and applied research over the past several years. However, the performance of all NIM applications is significantly limited by the inherent and strong energy dissipation in metals, especially in the near-infrared and visible wavelength ranges. Generally the losses are orders of magnitude too large for the proposed applications, and the reduction of losses with optimized designs seems to be out of reach. One way of addressing this issue is to incorporate gain media into NIM designs. However, whether NIMs with low loss can be achieved has been the subject of theoretical debate. Here we experimentally demonstrate that the incorporation of gain material in the high-local-field areas of a metamaterial makes it possible to fabricate an extremely low-loss and active optical NIM. The original loss-limited negative refractive index and the figure of merit (FOM) of the device have been drastically improved with loss compensation in the visible wavelength range between 722 and 738 nm. In this range, the NIM becomes active such that the sum of the light intensities in transmission and reflection exceeds the intensity of the incident beam. At a wavelength of 737 nm, the negative refractive index improves from -0.66 to -1.017 and the FOM increases from 1 to 26. At 738 nm, the FOM is expected to become macroscopically large, of the order of 10(6). This study demonstrates the possibility of fabricating an optical negative-index metamaterial that is not limited by the inherent loss in its metal constituent.},
